# USE CASE FOR FUNCTIONAL DESIGN

Based on the case it explains that the User doesn't have any capabilities to do a 'Sign Up' or 'Register Account'. To add this I figured to use an admin for generating new Accounts in the System.
For the flow it will be explained in the Activity Diagram.

1. User
- Stores basic user info (UserId, UserName, Password).
- One user can have many roles.

2. Role
- Contains the list of system roles (RoleId, RoleName).
- One role can be assigned to many users.

3. UserRole
- Acts as a bridge table between User and Role.
- Defines which user has which role.
- Also has its own primary key: UserRoleId.

4. MasterPage
- Stores information about system pages a role can access.
- Linked to UserRole → meaning different roles can access different pages.

UserId and Password would be generated by the system

## Change Password

RoleId would be generated by the system
